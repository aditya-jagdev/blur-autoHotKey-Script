# blur-custom-controls
Blur does not allow you to change the keybinds. I made this to get around that.
Works with Blur keyboard layout 2.

## How do I use this?
0. Download this tool by clicking the green `Code` button and click `Download ZIP`. Extract the files anywhere you want.

1. Install the latest version of AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/).
    * Tested with `v1.1.33.10`

2. Run the script directly (NOT RECOMMENDED), or right click, compile, and run the generated `.exe` file (RECOMMENDED).

3. The script is `ON` by default. Press `F5` to toggle it.

## I want to use a different set of bindings!
* Modify the keybinds to your liking by editing the `.ahk` file.

## I need more help.
* Please open an issue. I'll get back to you within a week.

## Why should I trust this?
* If you have concerns around security, please go ahead and use your favorite antivirus to scan it.
* You may also refer to the VirusTotal report here:
